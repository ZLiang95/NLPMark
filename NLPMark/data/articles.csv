3010365629,"Abstract   This paper aims to present insights about distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation technology diffusion in the household market. A quantitative approach using the Bass model to project distributed PV systems adoption is chosen to base and conduct the analysis. Since distributed PV in Brazil still presents a very small market penetration, historical data is still insufficient to obtain robust estimates. Therefore, parameters from PV markets of other countries and parameters from the solar water heaters (SWH) market in Brazil are used in the analysis. The latter approach is carefully justified. A comparative analysis of distributed PV and SWH market features indicates that SWH diffusion parameters lead to a better representation of innovators behavior for residential PV adoption in Brazil than the parameters borrowed from other countries, which are used by the official projections performed by the Brazilian regulator of the electricity sector. Moreover, we propose a different approach for estimating the final potential market. We discuss the limitations of the official projections, since results indicate that official projections overestimated the diffusion of residential PV market in the early years. Finally, it is suggested that inaccurate signals could be given to stakeholders."

3010365661,"Abstract. FFCam is a variable star near the North celestial pole with hydrogen linesin emission. Its optical variability of ∼0.3 mag was discovered by HIPPARCOS. Thespectral type assigned to the star in SIMBAD is B9, but its position coincides witha ROSAT X–ray source. This suggests the presence of a high-temperature region in thesystem that could originate at or near a companion object. We undertook a spectroscopicmonitoring of FFCam since the beginning of 2012 and found an extremely variable Hαline proﬁle as well as periodically variable radial velocities of numerous absorption lines.The main conclusion from our study is that FFCam is a binary system with an orbitalperiod of 7.785 days, a B–type primary and a K–type secondary component. We discussthe spectral features, their variations, and the nature of FFCam.Key words: emission-line stars - circumstellar matter - binary systems 1. IntroductionFFCam = HD60062 is a fairly bright (V ∼7.5–8.0 mag) star not far fromthe North Celestial Pole (R.A. 7h 47m, Dec. +81"

3010365702,"In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of the positioning and navigation system of the intelligent-motion objects in complex environment, and to solve the precision reduction problem of the integrated navigation system caused by the error accumulation of the visual odometry (VO) with motion and the inaccurate modeling of VO noise, an IMU/visual odometry integrated navigation method based on measurement model optimization is proposed. With Kalman filter as the framework, we constructs the state equation by the error recurrence model of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and based on the characteristics of the relative pose output of VO, we consider VO as an angular velocity, line velocity and position sensor to construct the measurement equation. The method has been evaluated by KITTI odometry benchmark and the results indicate that comparing to traditional integration of position and attitudes, the measurement model of this method is more consistent with the noise characteristics of VO and thus can improve the accuracy and reliability of the integrated navigation system."

The control activities are useful to identify the system performance and design requirements. The efforts have been made by the researchers to initiate different approaches to direct the best effective model. The state-space analysis has been introduced to analyze different control performances such as controllability, observability and stability testing of the standard artificial arm model after producing the closed loop representation by the simulation approach using Jury stability and Lyapunov stability analysis. The control action analysis shows the relevancy and the precision of the proposed mathematical model."

3010365842,"Jasmonates (JAs), the group of lipid-derived hormones, were found to control the defense responses in a myriad of plants. Meaningfully, the macrolactones of 12-hydroxy jasmonate isoleucine (12OH-JA-Ile) were reported to induce the defensive response of wild tobacco. However, little to nothing has been known about the elicitation effect of JA-Ile-macrolactones on woody plants to harmful organisms, let alone its underlying mechanisms. Here, we first optimized the synthetic routine using mild toxic reagent isobutyl chloroformate instead of ethyl chloroformate for conjugation, and we used acetonitrile (MeCN) instead of ethyl alcohol for the better dissolution of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) to gain JA-Ile-macrolactones. JA-Ile-macrolactone 5b-treated tea plants significantly inhibited the larvae weight gain of Ectropis obliqua larvae and the lesions caused by Colletotrichum camelliae. Furthermore, the expression level of CsOPR3 was significantly upregulated in 5b-treated leaves. Meanwhile, 5b reduced the accumulation of eriodictyol 7-O-glucuronide (EDG) in tea plants, which was confirmed to promote the growth rate of E. obliqua larvae by artificial diet assay. In conclusion, our study proved that the exogenous application of 5b could induce the tea plant resistance both to herbivore E. obliqua and pathogen C. camelliae, and EDG was identified as one of the secondary metabolites that could influence the growth rate of E. obliqua, but it did not directly influence the infection of C. camelliae in vitro. Further research should be carried out to clarify the mechanism through which 5b induces tea plant resistance to C. camelliae."

3010365683,"Rampant, irrational and unscientific use of antimicrobials by the healthcare practitioners is adding to the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to evolve and implement new policies, recommence research actions and pursue steps to manage the crisis of antimicrobial resistance, which can be accomplished by a well-designed Antimicrobial Stewardship programme. A prospective observational study aiming to investigate the use of antimicrobials in Intensive Care Units by means of an AMS programme was carried out in a 400 bedded tertiary level hospital in New Delhi with 140 ICU beds. This evidence-based study looksinto the prescription and consumption of antimicrobials, specifically in the ICUs, and attempts to corelate it with the resistance pattern of antimicrobials being used. All the patients being treated with antimicrobials, admitted in the ICUs of the hospital were selected for this descriptive research. Information associated with antimicrobials including the susceptibility pattern of isolates and full dosage regime of each patient from the group was obtained by conducting daily audits for a period of five months. Among the usage of different antimicrobial categories (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral), the resistance percentage correlation was predominantly focused on theantibacterial. However, the study suggests no conclusive direct or indirect correlation between the usage of an antibacterial (in terms of prescription and consumption) and its resistance, which itself could be a cause of concern for medical practitioners."

Lemongrass oil (Cymbopogon citratus) cannot be used directly because it is not comfortable to use, so it will be made in the form of shampoo gel. This study aims to see the effect of carbopol variation on the physical quality test of shampoo gel and get the best formula seen from the physical quality of shampoo gel.Lemongrass oil (Cymbopogon citratus) shampoo gel made 3 formulas with a concentration of 1,6%, 1.8%, 2,0% carbopol. Tests carried out for 4 weeks on the physical quality of the emulgel tested included organoleptic, homogeneity, pH, viscosity, foam stability. Data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics version 18.0 program with one way ANOVA method and Independent T-test.The result showed that the carbopol concentration produced a good shampoo gel preparation and had an effect on the quality of the shampoo gel which included organoleptic, viscosity, foam stability. The higher the carbopol concentration, the higher the viscosity value but the lower the stability value of foam.Keywords:Lemongrass oil gel shampoo, carbopol, physical quality test"
3010365671,"In order to investigate the decision of the airport taxi driver whether to return to carry passengers, we established a fuzzy evaluation decision model based on the analytic hierarchy process, combined with the application analysis of Shanghai Pudong Airport. Based on the selection and quantification of decision indicators, we used the AHP method to calculate the weights to eliminate indicators and optimize the indicator system. Then, a two-level fuzzy evaluation model was established, and the Bayesian discriminant verification model was more reasonable. Finally, based on the data analysis of Shanghai Pudong Airport, combined with 16 different airport decision-making situations, the model was used to obtain the no-load return trips and the membership of waiting passengers. We compared and selected the larger membership value as the decision. Besides, the dependence of the model was analyzed, and it was found that the main dependent factors for decision-making were the number of flight arrivals and the driver’s arrival time. After solving the above, we provide relevant basis for the decision of airport taxi drivers."
